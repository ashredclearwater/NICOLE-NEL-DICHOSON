<h2>About me! <3</h2>
<p> A fourteen year old student at LPSCI. My name is Nicole Nel M. Dichoson, or as I like to go by my nickname given to me by my friend, <i> Nicho. </i> I like to describe myself as an enthusiastic, energetic, extroverted, talkative, supportive, helpful, and a kind friend. Although I may not appear as a friend to everyone, I cherish and keep every single one of my friends deep in my heart.   
<br>
<br>
I have A lot of hobbies. To name a few, I love reading, writing (that includes poetry, essays and fan fictions), drawing, listening to music, and hanging out with my friends. I like only very few sports, though to name all; It's badminton and archery. I often surround myself with my friends since I prefer to be with the people I love than being on my own, which probably doesnt make me an introvert.
<br>
<br>
Im into anime. Currently, the animes that I'm watching right now are Jujutsu Kaisen and The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. My favorite artists are all mixed up since i love a lot of genres. To name a few, I'd say Deftones, Lana Del Ray, The Smiths, Arctic Monkeys, Gigi Perez, Melanie Martinez, Bruno Mars, and finally ABBA.
