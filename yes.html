<h2> Reflection! <3 </h2>
<p> In this First Quarter, I learned about the core elements of HTML: lists, tables, hyperlinks, and forms, which are essential for structuring and enhancing web content. Lists (both ordered and unordered) are useful for organizing information in a clear manner, while tables help present data in rows and columns, making it easier to read and interpret. I also explored how hyperlinks create connections between web pages, allowing users to navigate smoothly, which is crucial for any website. Understanding these elements helped me grasp how basic web structure is formed and how to enhance user experience by organizing content effectively.
<br>
<br>
Forms, on the other hand, are a vital part of interaction on websites. I practiced creating forms with different input types, like text fields, buttons, and checkboxes, which collect user information. Combined with hyperlinks, forms enable sites to be more interactive and functional. Working with these elements has improved my web development skills, and I can now build pages that are both user-friendly and informative. Moving forward, I aim to enhance my understanding of styling these elements for better visual design and usability.
